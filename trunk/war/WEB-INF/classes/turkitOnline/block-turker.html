<h2>Please return this HIT</h2>
<p>You have done nothing wrong.
However, for some reason, the requester for this HIT does not want you to complete it.
This is probably because you have already participated in a group of HITs
that are building on each other,
and the requester wants to ensure that a variety of people work on the job.
You may still be able to participate in future HITs in this process.</p>

<p><small>NOTE: This message is a temporary fix;
we hope that Mechanical Turk itself will allow us to block specific workers
from particular HITs, so that they do not show up under "HITs Available To You".

<p><b>Sorry for the inconvenience.</b></p>
