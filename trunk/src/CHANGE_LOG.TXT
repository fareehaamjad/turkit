

-------------------------------
version 0.1.29

- Java API change: TurKit.runOnce now accepts different parameters.

- JavaScript API change:
	- new "slurp" function which accepts a filename/path and returns the file contents as a string 
	- MTurk.vote now returns an additional parameter: the hit as it looked right before it was deleted

- highlightDiff moved from turkit.js to util.js (no effect visible to users, except in documentation)

- bug fix: now able to load database files of arbitrary size.
	It used to be that TurKit could not reload the database for some TurKit programs,
	if they were too large.
	
- minor bug fixes:
	- task-template.html now disables buttons as well as inputs and textareas
	- fixed problem when reseting database if no HITs had been created
	- fixed bug in mturk.deleteHITRaw, triggered when deleting a HITs where some assignments had been approved already

-------------------------------
version 0.1.27-test

- TurKit now tries to notice when you call "once" functions out of order.
	This should help catch cases where you edit your program in "illegal" ways,
	that get the program execution out of step with the memoized execution trace.

- printed messages, like "hit created" are now shown every time the program is run.
	This means you will still have access to that url that it shows,
	even if you re-run the program.

-------------------------------
version 0.1.26-test


- "Reset Database" now deletes all the HITs and S3 Objects associated with the database.
	In particular, any time you call mturk.createHIT or s3.putObject in a TurKit program,
	the HIT Id or S3 Object URL is stored in the database,
	and when the database is reset, all of these HITs and S3 Objects are removed.

- new function mturk.deleteHITRaw
- the deleteHIT functions now work better -- in general, they will always succeed at deleting the HIT,
	no matter what state it is in, even if turkers are currently working on assignments for the HIT.
	Note that all assignments that haven't been rejected for the HIT will be approved
	(this is consistent with the previous behavior).

- deleteHIT now removes the HIT from "__HITs" in the database
- "Delete HITs" button changed to "Delete All HITs" (performs same function)
- the global value "__HITs" in the database is now an object (each key is a HIT Id), as opposed to an Array

- when S3 objects are created or deleted, the new "__S3_Objects" variable in the database is updated.
	It stores the URLs for each S3 Object as a key.
	
- new function s3.getURL, useful for constructing an S3 URL based on a bucket name and a key
