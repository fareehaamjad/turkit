version 0.1.26-test


- "Reset Database" now deletes all the HITs and S3 Objects associated with the database.
	In particular, any time you call mturk.createHIT or s3.putObject in a TurKit program,
	the HIT Id or S3 Object URL is stored in the database,
	and when the database is reset, all of these HITs and S3 Objects are removed.

- new function mturk.deleteHITRaw
- the deleteHIT functions now work better -- in general, they will always succeed at deleting the HIT,
	no matter what state it is in, even if turkers are currently working on assignments for the HIT.
	Note that all assignments that haven't been rejected for the HIT will be approved
	(this is consistent with the previous behavior).

- deleteHIT now removes the HIT from "__HITs" in the database
- "Delete HITs" button changed to "Delete All HITs" (performs same function)
- the global value "__HITs" in the database is now an object (each key is a HIT Id), as opposed to an Array

- when S3 objects are created or deleted, the new "__S3_Objects" variable in the database is updated.
	It stores the URLs for each S3 Object as a key.
	
- new function s3.getURL, useful for constructing an S3 URL based on a bucket name and a key
