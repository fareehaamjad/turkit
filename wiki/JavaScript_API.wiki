#summary Functions exposed to JavaScript.

== bobble(String _query_) ==

The _query_ is executed inside the persistent JavaScript bobble, and a deep-clone of the object inside the bobble is returned to the caller's environment. The _query_ is wrapped inside a lambda function before being executed. This allows you to create local variable with _var_, and requires you to use _return_ in order to get data back.

Example:
{{{
bobble("var a = 5; b = 7; return 8")
}}}
This example evaluates to 8. It also has the side-effect of modifying the global variable _b_ inside the bobble. The variable _a_ is local to the query, and does not have any lasting effect on the bobble's environment.
